/**
Polymorphism enables us to invoke derive class methods using base class reference variable at runtime
Polymorphism allows us to invoke a derived class method through a base class reference during runtime.
The virtual keyword declares that the method can be overridden in any base class
there Are two types of polymorphism :
1. Runtime time Polymorphism : method overriding  also known as dynamic binding or late binding
2. compile Time polymorphism: method  and operator overloading  also known as static binding or early binding
